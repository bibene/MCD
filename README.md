MCD is a single html file webapplication (dependencies: JQuery, JQuery Mobile, Underscore.js). You can host it or use it from a local storage on your PC or other device.

Data it stored loacaly in the browser and never leaves your device. External crypto currency data is retrieved form coinmarketcap.com.

If You feel like donating then please consider a donation to [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com), without their API this application would not be possible. After that you can buy me a beer:
- BTC: 1M6uGrB9Mesm3gGhEjCT1MK1azn16pVxs3 
- ETH: 0x6d22adF55901C0482f5c5406dA665b3A4eF0adb4

Some TODOs for the future:
- icons so it looks good when put on android or iPhone homescreen 
- refactoring and code cleanup (one global variable, separate logic from UI, nicer API call limiting, ..) 
- implement details pages for each coin type
- nicer UI for adding, modifying and removing coins
- besides entering amounts also allow adding address, the amounts should be fetched automatically (and periodically)
- import and export
